## Built with vuejs/vite

(https://github.com/vuejs/vite)

## Problems to solve

 - Where to put static assets like images for them to be included in `dist`?
 
 - `yarn build` fails in netlify (so I have to build locally and commit / push `dist`!)

 - Google Tag script gets removed from index.html at build time?!
